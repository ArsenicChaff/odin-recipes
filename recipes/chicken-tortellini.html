            <h2>Alright, it's high time for the good stuff.</h2>
                <h4>The <em>instructions.</em> I know, juicy right?</h4>
                <h3>Step by Step:</h3>
                    <p>All the ingredients are down below, just incase you need em :)</p>
                    <p>I also recommend reading all the directions before starting. Helps out I promise!</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Whats first:</b></li>
                                <p>Grab all your ingredients, and bring a large saucepan
                                    with salted water to a boil over high heat. At the same
                                    time, heat a large skillet over medium, and add chopped
                                    bacon. Stir occasionally for about 8 minutes. Move the 
                                    bacon to a paper towel lined plate, and make sure to leave
                                    about 3 tablespoon of the drippings in the skillet.
                                </p>

                            <li><b>Now for the Chicken:</b></li>
                                <p>While the bacon cooks, sprinkle the pepper and 1/4 tsp of
                                    salt over the chicken. Add the chicken to the skillet once
                                    the bacon is finished, leave the drippings in there, and
                                    cook over medium high until chicken is browned and cooked
                                    through (thickest part of the chicken reaches 165 degreed F).
                                    It's okay to reduce the heat if the chicken starts to char
                                    before fully cooked. Trasfer to a plate, and chop into small pieces
                                    after 10 minutes of resting.
                                </p>

                            <li><b>Sundried Tomatoes are Wildly Underrated:</b></li>
                                <p>Reduce the heat to medium, and add sundried tomatoes and shallot
                                    to the skillet. Cook for about 2 minutes until softened, and add 
                                    garlic, italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and the last of the
                                    salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. About 30 to 60
                                    seconds. Add tomato paste, and cook for another minute, stirring
                                    constantly.
                                </p>

                            <li><b>Put it All Together: (well, half of it)</b></li>
                                <p>Pour in your chicken broth (in the skillet), stirring and scraping
                                    the bottom of the pan to get all of that <em>flavor</em>. Stir in 
                                    cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Keep it simmering,
                                    stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes until it thickens
                                    just a bit.
                                </p>

                            <li><b>Dont Forget about the Tortellini:</b></li>
                                <p>Add that tortellini to the boiling water and cook until they float,
                                    about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the tortellini, but save 1 cup of that
                                    noodle water. It has <em>flavor</em>. Stir the parm, bacon, chicken,
                                    and tortellini into the skillet with the creamy sauce. Cook and stir
                                    constantly, until nice and evenly coated. <em>Slowly</em> add that
                                    noodle water, until you get a desired consistency. Serve, and garnish
                                    with more parm and some basil!
