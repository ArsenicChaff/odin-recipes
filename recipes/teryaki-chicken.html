        <h2>Chicken has never been so <em>GOOD</em>.</h2>
            <p>This recipe is best served with some good sticky rice, and a bed
            of your favorite healthy veggies. Seriously, this chicken is good
            enough to make peas taste like dessert. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

        <h2>Let's get into it. Construction time.</h2>
            <h3>Step by Step:</h3>
            <p>All of the ingredients and quantities are listed below.</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Starting with the marinade:</b></li>
                        <p>Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, garlic,
                        ginger, and 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil in a bowl. Place the
                        chicken in another bowl, and pour the marinade over the top. Turn
                        the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well coated. 
                        Marinate for 30 minutes up to one day (refridgerated).
                        </p>
                    <li><b>And now we cook:</b></li>
                        <p>Heat the other tablespoon of cooking oil in a large skilet over
                        medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken and discard the remaining
                        marinade. Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until
                        cooked through (165 degrees F internal). The liquid in the skillet
                        should have reduced to a light glaze covering the chicken.
                        </p>
                    <li><b>I mean, that's basically it:</b></li>
                        <p>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 5
                        minutes before slicing and serving. Super simple really!
                        </p>
                </ol>
            </p>
